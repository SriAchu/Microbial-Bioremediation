# Microbial-Bioremediation
Bioremediation: Microbial Approach to Water Pollutant Degradation


This project develops an intelligent system for predicting bioremediating microorganisms based on water quality parameters to address pollution in aquatic ecosystems.
Utilizing a dataset that includes temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), conductivity, salinity, and nitrate concentration. A Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained to identify suitable microorganisms for specific types of pollution. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to input relevant parameters and indicate observed physical effects in the water body. The system then predicts the most effective microorganism for remediation, providing tailored recommendations. This integration of machine learning and environmental science aims to enhance decision-making in bioremediation efforts and promote sustainable ecosystem
restoration.
